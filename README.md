# EEG_based_emotion_recognition

The Data_preprocessed_python from [DEAP dataset](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/) is used for the experiments, where it contains a downsampled (to 128Hz), preprocessed and segmented version of the data in pickled python/numpy (data_preprocessed_python.zip) format. This version of the data is well-suited to those wishing to quickly test a classification or regression technique without the hassle of processing all the data first. Each zip file contains 32 .dat (python) files, one per participant.  

I have dumped all the Jupyter Notebook I currently have in this repository. This was the project I have done during my undergrad thesis back in 2021. Please read the available manuscripts mentioned in the acknowledgement for your reference.
